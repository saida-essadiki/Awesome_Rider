This game is dedicated to young car lovers, where they can learn more about cars in a fun and entertaining way. The main character of our game is the player (the car), which will move in 2 directions, and jump to avoid the traps. While driving around the city, the player will face traps and cars coming from the opposite direction as obstacles to avoid in order to win, at the same time there will be magazines as collectibles on the road which the player should drive nearby in order to collect them, each level will have a fixed number of magazines that the player should collect in order to win. The reward here will be a small informative article about cars. While doing this task the player should keep an eye on the fuel level that will be displayed on the screen and try to collect fuel gallons found on the road to be able to finish the game. Finally, there will be spots in the city where the car should go to answer some related car questions in order to gain more points that the player could use as fuel.
